    "faq": {
      "q1": "What does it mean that the project is a housing cooperative and how does it differ from buying from a traditional developer?",
      "a1": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Active member participation:</strong> you can vote and decide on finishes, layout and other project milestones.</li>\n<li><strong>15‑20 % savings</strong> compared with a traditional developer (their profit margin disappears).</li>\n<li><strong>Tax advantages:</strong> the cooperative is exempt from ITP/AJD when purchasing the land.</li>\n<li><strong>Professional management:</strong> a specialised team handles the administrative, commercial, technical and financial aspects.</li>\n<li><strong>Funds in custody:</strong> payments are deposited in a notarial escrow account and may only be released under the conditions stated in the notarial deed.</li>\n<li><strong>Guarantee or surety:</strong> once the permit is granted, all amounts are secured by bank guarantee or surety insurance in accordance with the Spanish Building Act (LOE).</li>\n</ul>",

      "q2": "How much do I have to pay to reserve a home and how is my money protected (bank guarantees or surety policies)?",
      "a2": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Reservation payment:</strong> usually between €3,000 and €5,000, depending on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Notarial escrow:</strong> the amount is deposited in an escrow account governed by a notarial deed that specifies when the funds may be used.</li>\n<li><strong>Before the permit:</strong> the LOE does not require a special account or guarantees, but the cooperative still uses a notarial account for extra security.</li>\n<li><strong>Release of funds:</strong> always subject to the notary’s approval.</li>\n</ul>",

      "q3": "What is the approximate timeline (permit, start of construction, key hand‑over) and what happens if there are delays?",
      "a3": "<ul>\n<li>Formation and organisation of the cooperative.</li>\n<li>Application for and <strong>obtaining the building permit</strong> (timing depends on the Town Hall).</li>\n<li><strong>Start of construction</strong> once the permit is granted and financing is closed.</li>\n<li><strong>Construction period</strong>: 12‑24 months depending on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Allocation deed</strong> and key hand‑over.</li>\n<li>If delays occur, the penalty or extension clauses in the statutes and construction contract will apply.</li>\n</ul>",

      "q4": "What additional costs and taxes will I have to pay (VAT, notary, registry, plusvalía, community fees) and when are they due?",
      "a4": "<ul>\n<li><strong>VAT 10 %</strong> (or the applicable rate) on each payment.</li>\n<li><strong>Notary and land‑registry fees:</strong> 0.5‑1 % of the price.</li>\n<li><strong>Stamp Duty (AJD):</strong> 1.2 % in Andalusia because the sale is subject to VAT.</li>\n<li><strong>Community fees</strong> from the hand‑over date, according to your ownership share.</li>\n<li><strong>Municipal plusvalía tax:</strong> paid by the cooperative, not by the member.</li>\n</ul>",

      "q5": "I do not live in Spain. What paperwork do I need (NIE, bank account, power of attorney) and who can help me in another language?",
      "a5": "<ul>\n<li>Valid identity document from your country (ID card or passport).</li>\n<li><strong>NIE</strong> (Foreigner Identification Number), mandatory for any real‑estate purchase in Spain.</li>\n<li><strong>Power of attorney:</strong> not required if you will attend the signing in person; otherwise it can be granted in Spain or at a Spanish consulate.</li>\n<li>If the power is executed before a foreign notary it must be <em>apostilled (Hague)</em> and accompanied by a sworn translation.</li>\n<li>Our Legal Department can arrange NIEs, powers of attorney, translations and act on your behalf in your language.</li>\n</ul>"
